5.1	Test Recording Procedures
5.1.1	Sample Log-in
Each sample, with the exception of concrete, submitted to the laboratory for testing is entered into the company database, which assigns a numeric lab number, not to be shared with any other sample, for continued reference. Concrete samples, however, will be given an alphanumeric lab number. When any sample is logged in, including concrete, the following information is recorded; project number, project name, client name, material description, tests required, date received, and any pertinent comments.     

5.1.2	Material Testing
Once the sample has been submitted and properly logged in, a technician is assigned to perform the work by the Laboratory Manager or their designee. Procedures utilized in conducting tests, inspections, analysis, and research, etc. are normally those outlined in applicable standards from AASHTO, ASTM, or ADOT. If the procedure to be utilized in testing the material is not from one of these recognizable agencies, the technician is instructed as to the testing procedure to be followed and the specifications governing the particular project or test type. Test results are recorded on standard worksheets. The worksheets are kept with the technician during immediate testing and are kept in the "Work In Progress" basket at other times (curing, soaking, drying, etc.). When the testing is complete, the worksheet is placed into the "Work Completed" basket. The data is reviewed by the Laboratory Manager or designee, and the information released.

5.1.3	Departures from Standard Testing/Reporting Procedures
In general, all testing is done in accordance with either ASTM, AASHTO, or other agency standards. In cases where a client requests a departure from any of these standards, the request shall be reviewed and approved by the appropriate Laboratory Manager prior to implementation. Consultation with the Laboratory Division Manager may be appropriate in cases of extreme departure. All departures from appropriate standards shall be documented in the report.

5.2	Report Generation
5.2.1	Internal Reports
Internal reports are those reports that are not typed and submitted on company letterhead, but are generally reported to a technician or client in worksheet form. These are typically associated with Arizona Department of Transportation projects.
In regards to report handling, all laboratory and field test forms will be filled out completely and accurately by the technician performing the testing. It is the responsibility of the Quality Assurance Manager, or designee, to instruct the technicians in the proper use of the test forms, as well as to demonstrate any necessary calculations. Completed forms are submitted to the Laboratory Manager or designee, for review. Any problems or missing items will be discussed with the performing technician. Copies of the test data are to be provided to the technician, or client that requested the testing so that it may be included in the technician’s file. Original test forms are to be filed, and copies distributed to Divisional Managers (when necessary) by the Laboratory Manager.  The files are kept in the laboratory file for the project for which the testing was done. 

5.2.2 	External Reports
External reports are those reports that are typed and submitted on company letterhead. 
Client reports will be submitted on a Technical Report Form showing the client's identification, project name, project number, sample identification, sample location, sample number, test results, person performing test, date sampled, date tested, date reported, deviations from the standards, and signature of Laboratory Manager or Laboratory Divisional Manger. These reports will also include diameter, cross sectional area, maximum load, compressive strength, type of fracture (if not conical), defects (specimen or caps) and the age of the specimen. It is the responsibility of the Laboratory Managers to review reports for completeness and accuracy prior to client submittal.  The procedure for distribution of records is the same for internal and external reports. 

5.2.3	Distribution of Reports
Reports will be distributed either in hard-copy form by mail, or in digital form by email. Reports are to be distributed only after carefully determining who the client contact is or receiving an approved distribution list from the client. Digital reports shall be sent in a secure, PDF format, and only through Speedie & Associates’ secure Microsoft Exchange Mail Server. All information, results, recommendations, etc., are the sole property of the client, and will be distributed only as they request.

5.2.4	Amended Reports
When a report must be amended, a report form shall be completed indicating the amended test results. The comment section of the report shall state the reason for the amended report. The amended report shall be clearly labeled as “AMENDED REPORT” and shall be attached to the original report and processed in the normal manner. The amended report shall be filed with the original report.

5.3	Records Retention
Records pertaining to testing, equipment calibration and verification, test reports, internal quality system reviews, proficiency sample testing, technician training and competency evaluations, and personnel matters shall be retained for a minimum of five years.

5.3.1	Client Confidentiality Agreement
It is the policy of Speedie and Associates to treat all materials and samples received as confidential. No information related to the materials projects or its test results will be released to any third party without prior authorization from the client unless required by law.

5.4	Sample Management
5.4.1	Transporting Samples
5.4.1.1		Concrete Test Specimens
It is typically the responsibility of the technician fabricating the concrete test specimens to transport them back to the laboratory. If it is necessary for someone else to return the specimens to the laboratory, that person will be designated by the Laboratory Manager. The specimens shall be brought into the laboratory within 48 hours of fabrication, unless specific instructions otherwise are given. In all cases the specimens shall be transported in a protective box to keep the specimens from being damaged. Shortly after arrival at the laboratory, the specimens shall be stripped, labeled, and placed in a suitable environment to cure. 

5.4.1.2		Aggregate Test Samples
Technicians sampling aggregates at remote locations shall, after obtaining a sufficient size sample, place the sample in a suitable container that will prevent sample loss and/or contamination. Generally a canvas sack or a five-gallon bucket will be utilized. Carefully secure the specimens in the bed of their truck, making sure that each sample has been properly identified (by use of sample tags or labels on the bags). The samples are then transported to the laboratory, at which time a work request is completed and placed with sample prior to beginning any testing.

5.4.2	Sample Identification
Each sample shall be accompanied by a work order, or sample tag indicating the laboratory sample number, the client and project, and type of material. The work order or sample tag is kept with the sample until the sample is discarded.

5.4.3 	Sample Storage
After being logged in, samples are stored in the testing area, or the sample storage area. During storage, care is taken to avoid disturbance or contamination. Any requirements for storage outlined by the governing agency under which the testing is to be performed shall be followed (e.g., moist storage of Portland Cement concrete cylinders).

5.4.4	Sample Retention
5.4.4.1		Internally Reported Samples
Samples with acceptable test results are generally discarded when testing is complete, the resulting data reviewed, and no further testing required. 
5.4.4.2		Externally Reported Samples
Samples are generally retained for at least 30 days after testing is completed, or until work utilizing this material is completed (e.g., aggregates for Asphalt Concrete mix designs). Upon client request, samples may be retained for longer periods. After expiration of the time limit the client is contacted for sample disposal instructions.

5.4.5	Sample Disposal
5.4.5.1		Non-hazardous Materials
Non-hazardous materials are discarded in a waste container to be collected and hauled away by a contracted firm.
5.4.5.2		Hazardous Materials
Hazardous materials generated as part of the asphalt extraction test procedure are collected and stored in DOT approved containers and disposed of using a registered hazardous waste hauler. No Hazardous Materials are accepted by the Laboratory other than those specifically generated during testing.

6.1.2	Substandard Results and Corrective Measures
Records of all data from the above referenced programs are kept on file. The results of the Proficiency Tests are discussed with the technician(s) involved in performing the test(s). In addition, equipment performance and/or accuracy are evaluated as needed. Any proficiency sample test results beyond 2 standard deviations of the sample mean are considered poor. When this occurs following steps are taken:
•	Determine if the Agency conducting the program correctly entered the data reported. 
•	Determine if the test result obtained was properly transferred to the data sheet provided.
•	Determine if all calculations leading to the test results obtained were correct.
•	Determine if the equipment used to perform the test meets specification requirements.
•	Determine if the procedures followed when performing the test conformed to specification requirements.
•	Take corrective action to repair or replace defective equipment or instruct the technician of the correct procedure to follow.
•	Prepare a report of record summarizing the results of the investigation, identifying the cause of the poor results, if determined, and describing any corrective action taken.

The report is sent to the Agency conducting the program, with copies placed in the lab file containing original test data and the Agency correspondence file. Any necessary laboratory procedural changes will be immediately implemented by the Laboratory Manager or designee.

6.2	On-site Inspection Programs
Records of all inspection program information and reports are kept on file. The inspection reports are discussed with the Laboratory Division Manager and deficiencies noted and corrected. A written report is then sent to the agency outlining the findings and stating what corrective measures have been taken. A copy will be placed in the Agency correspondence file.

6.2.2	Deficiencies and Corrective Measures
When deficiencies are noted during on-site inspections, they will be classified and dealt with as outlined in the following sections.
6.2.2.1		Apparatus Deficiencies
The Quality Assurance Manager or designee will determine if the equipment meets specification requirements. If the equipment is found to be defective, necessary steps to repair or replace it will be taken. The Quality Assurance Manager or designee will prepare a report of record summarizing the results of the investigation, identifying the cause of the poor results, if determined, and describing any corrective action taken. The report is then placed in the Quality Assurance file as indicated in Section 4.1 above.
6.2.2.2		Procedural Deficiencies
The Quality Assurance Manager or designee will discuss each procedural deficiency with the testing technician and review the proper procedure. The Quality Assurance Manager or designee will prepare a report of record summarizing the results of the investigation, identifying the cause of the poor results, if determined, and describing any corrective action taken. All reports will be filed by the Quality Assurance Manager in the Quality Assurance file.
6.2.2.3		Quality System Deficiencies
The Quality Assurance Manager or designee shall review each deficiency cited by the evaluator with the Laboratory Division Manager. Corrective action will be taken to amend the deficiencies noted. The appropriate changes in the QSM document will be made and documented. A report will be issued detailing these changes. The Quality Assurance Manager will file all reports in the Quality Assurance file.
6.2.2.4		Addressing Invalid Test Results
If any of the deficiencies found during an on-site inspection or audit cast doubt on the validity of past test results, the Quality Assurance Manager and Assistant shall investigate the findings and circumstances to determine if any results reported to clients may have been affected. If it is determined that reported results are suspect, the client and any other relevant parties shall be notified immediately, in writing, of the deficiencies and planned corrective actions.

6.3	Internal Correlation Testing Program
Speedie and Associates maintains three permanent satellite laboratory facilities in Flagstaff, Tucson, and Show Low, Arizona.  In addition, we utilize portable laboratory facilities on temporary projects throughout the state.  In order to assure the accuracy of the testing performed at these laboratories, we will perform appropriate correlation testing and on-site inspections of the procedures and equipment used.
As a general rule, we will use AASHTO, CCRL and/or ADOT proficiency samples to evaluate the correlation of our satellite laboratories.  Any additional correlation testing performed will be evaluated using Table 1 in the ADOT sampling guide schedule.  This additional correlation testing will be performed on an as needed basis, and will be compared to the results obtained on samples tested in our central laboratory.
We will also conduct regular on-site reviews of our permanent satellite laboratories to ensure that they have accurate, current inspection and calibration records, as well as review technical competency.  Copies of all documentation for these procedures will be kept in the Quality Assurance file cabinet located outside of the dispatcher office.  

6.4	External Technical Complaints
All complaints received from clients will be investigated and responded to promptly. Complaints concerning laboratory results or procedures will be the responsibility of the appropriate Laboratory Manager. Complaints concerning field results or procedures will be the responsibility of the Field Services Division Manager.
When a complaint is received, the test data and equipment used will be reviewed for correctness and accuracy. The situation will be discussed with the technician(s) who performed the test(s). Every effort will be made to determine whether correct procedures were utilized. The appropriate supervisor will generate a report addressing all areas pertaining to the complaint. He will then submit it to the appropriate engineer for review. The report, including all conclusions and an amended test report, if necessary, will be issued to the client. 

7. INTERNAL QUALITY SYSTEM REVIEW
7.1	Internal Review
The Quality Assurance Manager shall review the appropriate records, reports, and associated documentation every twelve months to ensure that the established quality procedures are being followed.
