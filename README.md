These calibration records shall contain certificates or other documents that establish traceability of in-house equipment or reference standards used for calibration or verification. Calibration and Verification intervals are established and recorded in the Internal Procedures Manual (referenced below).

####	Equipment Maintenance

The Quality Assurance Manager will maintain a file for each piece of equipment requiring maintenance. The file shall contain records of maintenance work performed, along with the manufacturer instructions (if applicable) and shall be kept electronically in a Quality Assurance directory on the company server.

####	Defective Equipment/Deficient Testing Procedures

When equipment has been found to be defective or testing procedures are found to be deficient, the Lab Manager under the direction of the QA Manager shall pull the reports of samples that may have been impacted by the defective equipment or deficient testing procedures to determine whether or not the defective equipment or deficient procedures had an impact on test results. The findings of this study shall be submitted to the QA Manager for review and filing. The client shall be notified of the possibility of nonconforming test results, and, if necessary, the potential significance of any deficiency on reported results.  Material permitting, the results in question shall be performed a second time to compare with the initial results that were found to be deficient either by defective equipment or deficient testing procedures.  Depending on the outcome of the compared results, an amendment to the initial report shall be made available to the client/clients.

####	Repaired Equipment

Our [Equipment & Consumables Database](https://airtable.com/shr5RBzpCltgQRrGH) contains a section for tracking the [service history of a piece of equipment](https://airtable.com/shr8HN9SqHIWAAcfs). When equipment is in need of repair, it shall be pulled out of service, and an entry made explaining the repairs required. When the equipment is ready for use again, it shall be re-calibrated (if the nature of the repair requires it), and an entry made in its service history explaining that it has been put back into service. Any documentation of the repair or service, such as receipts or records, shall be uploaded to the service record in the database as well.

####	Calibration and Verification Procedures

The Quality Assurance Manager shall maintain the [Equipment & Consumables Database](https://airtable.com/shr5RBzpCltgQRrGH), which includes each piece of equipment requiring calibration or verification. Each item shall contain information stating name of equipment, inventory number, condition when received, date placed in service, calibration frequency, previous calibration dates, and next date of calibration.

Required equipment shall be calibrated at specified intervals following the procedures indicated below. Equipment that is used over a range of measurements (e.g., thermometers, dial indicators, calipers, ovens), the calibration or standardization procedure shall specify measurements taken over that range unless otherwise specified by (1) the manufacturer of the equipment, or (2) in a consensus calibration standard that is being referenced. Newly acquired equipment without manufacturer's certification and equipment that has not been calibrated or verified because it has been removed from service shall be calibrated or verified before being placed in service. When any piece of equipment is broken, gives results that are suspect, or does not meet specification tolerances, the Quality Assurance Manager shall clearly label the equipment as out of service and remove it from service. The equipment shall be returned to service only after appropriate repairs are made and calibration or verification shows the equipment to function satisfactorily or to meet specification tolerances.

Equipment whose accuracy or operation may be sensitive to relocation (eg. scales) shall be re-calibrated after being moved or used in the field, prior to being put back into service.

In-house calibration and verification is performed under the supervision of the Quality Assurance Manager. Calibration due dates are entered and tracked in Todoist (a cross-platform task management application), and when equipment comes due for calibration, the Quality Assurance Manager or designee shall perform the calibration, submit the appropriate records to the [calibration records section](https://airtable.com/shrkcVB1oNDgBD4xC) of the inventory database, update the equipment's status in the inventory database, and mark the task as done in Todoist. When the task is marked as done, the recurring due date will reset itself based on the appropriately entered interval for that type of equipment (for example, a 1 year interval for proctor hammers).

A sub-contractor calibrates compression machines, reference thermometers, proving rings, stability/flow machines, and possibly other equipment that our laboratory is not equipped to handle. The Quality Assurance Manager shall schedule the external calibrations and maintain the appropriate calibration records.

####	Internal Procedures

Internal procedures used for calibration and/or verification of equipment not calibrated in accordance with NIST or other nationally recognized standards organizations can be found in the [Internal Procedures section](https://airtable.com/shrvnN3anUN5wqa8n) of our Equipment database. All equipment used to perform these internal procedures have certificates of traceability located in the Quality Assurance directory on the company server.

	Test Recording Procedures
</h3>

####	Sample Log-in

Each sample, with the exception of concrete, submitted to the laboratory for testing is entered into the company database, which assigns a numeric lab number, not to be shared with any other sample, for continued reference. Concrete samples, however, will be given an alphanumeric lab number. When any sample is logged in, including concrete, the following information is recorded; project number, project name, client name, material description, tests required, date received, and any pertinent comments.     

####	Material Testing

Once the sample has been submitted and properly logged in, a technician is assigned to perform the work by the Laboratory Manager or their designee. Procedures utilized in conducting tests, inspections, analysis, and research, etc. are normally those outlined in applicable standards from AASHTO, ASTM, or ADOT. If the procedure to be utilized in testing the material is not from one of these recognizable agencies, the technician is instructed as to the testing procedure to be followed and the specifications governing the particular project or test type. Test results are recorded on standard worksheets. The worksheets are kept with the technician during immediate testing and are kept in the "Work In Progress" basket at other times (curing, soaking, drying, etc.). When the testing is complete, the worksheet is placed into the "Work Completed" basket. The data is reviewed by the Laboratory Manager or designee, and the information released.

####	Departures from Standard Testing/Reporting Procedures

In general, all testing is done in accordance with either ASTM, AASHTO, or other agency standards. In cases where a client requests a departure from any of these standards, the request shall be reviewed and approved by the appropriate Laboratory Manager prior to implementation. Consultation with the Laboratory Division Manager may be appropriate in cases of extreme departure. All departures from appropriate standards shall be documented in the report.

<h3><a id="report-generation"></a>
	Report Generation
</h3>

####	Internal Reports

Internal reports are those reports that are not typed and submitted on company letterhead, but are generally reported to a technician or client in worksheet form. These are typically associated with Arizona Department of Transportation projects.

In regards to report handling, all laboratory and field test forms will be filled out completely and accurately by the technician performing the testing. It is the responsibility of the Quality Assurance Manager, or designee, to instruct the technicians in the proper use of the test forms, as well as to demonstrate any necessary calculations. Completed forms are submitted to the Laboratory Manager or designee, for review. Any problems or missing items will be discussed with the performing technician. Copies of the test data are to be provided to the technician, or client that requested the testing so that it may be included in the technician’s file. Original test forms are to be filed, and copies distributed to Divisional Managers (when necessary) by the Laboratory Manager.  The files are kept in the laboratory file for the project for which the testing was done.

####	External Reports

External reports are those reports that are typed and submitted on company letterhead.

Client reports will be submitted on a Technical Report Form showing the client's identification, project name, project number, sample identification, sample location, sample number, test results, person performing test, date sampled, date tested, date reported, deviations from the standards, and signature of Laboratory Manager or Laboratory Divisional Manger. These reports will also include diameter, cross sectional area, maximum load, compressive strength, type of fracture (if not conical), defects (specimen or caps) and the age of the specimen. It is the responsibility of the Laboratory Managers to review reports for completeness and accuracy prior to client submittal.  The procedure for distribution of records is the same for internal and external reports.

####	Distribution of Reports

Reports will be distributed either in hard-copy form by mail, or in digital form by email. Reports are to be distributed only after carefully determining who the client contact is or receiving an approved distribution list from the client. Digital reports shall be sent in a secure, PDF format, and only through Speedie & Associates’ secure Microsoft Exchange Mail Server. All information, results, recommendations, etc., are the sole property of the client, and will be distributed only as they request.

####	Amended Reports

When a report must be amended, a report form shall be completed indicating the amended test results. The comment section of the report shall state the reason for the amended report. The amended report shall be clearly labeled as “AMENDED REPORT” and shall be attached to the original report and processed in the normal manner. The amended report shall be filed with the original report.

<h3><a id="records-retention"></a>
	Records Retention
</h3>

Records pertaining to testing, equipment calibration and verification, test reports, internal quality system reviews, proficiency sample testing, technician training and competency evaluations, and personnel matters shall be retained for a minimum of five years.

Many types of records are kept indefinitely, either in electronic form, or in file cabinets located on-site. For records that are disposed of after a speficied time period (a minimum of five years), digital records shall be deleted from any servers, drives, or web platforms on which they exist, and paper records shall be shredded.

####	Client Confidentiality Agreement

It is the policy of Speedie and Associates to treat all materials and samples received as confidential. No information related to the materials projects or its test results will be released to any third party without prior authorization from the client unless required by law.

<h3><a id="sample-management"></a>
	Sample Management
</h3>

####	Transporting Samples

**Concrete Test Specimens**<br/>
It is typically the responsibility of the technician fabricating the concrete test specimens to transport them back to the laboratory. If it is necessary for someone else to return the specimens to the laboratory, that person will be designated by the Laboratory Manager. The specimens shall be brought into the laboratory within 48 hours of fabrication, unless specific instructions otherwise are given. In all cases the specimens shall be transported in a protective box to keep the specimens from being damaged. Shortly after arrival at the laboratory, the specimens shall be stripped, labeled, and placed in a suitable environment to cure.

**Aggregate Test Samples**<br/>
Technicians sampling aggregates at remote locations shall, after obtaining a sufficient size sample, place the sample in a suitable container that will prevent sample loss and/or contamination. Generally a canvas sack or a five-gallon bucket will be utilized. Carefully secure the specimens in the bed of their truck, making sure that each sample has been properly identified (by use of sample tags or labels on the bags). The samples are then transported to the laboratory, at which time a work request is completed and placed with sample prior to beginning any testing.

####	Sample Identification

Each sample shall be accompanied by a work order, or sample tag indicating the laboratory sample number, the client and project, and type of material. The work order or sample tag is kept with the sample until the sample is discarded.

####	Sample Storage

After being logged in, samples are stored in the testing area, or the sample storage area. During storage, care is taken to avoid disturbance or contamination. Any requirements for storage outlined by the governing agency under which the testing is to be performed shall be followed (e.g., moist storage of Portland Cement concrete cylinders).

####	Sample Retention

**Internally Reported Samples**<br/>
Samples with acceptable test results are generally discarded when testing is complete, the resulting data reviewed, and no further testing required.

**Externally Reported Samples**<br/>
Samples are generally retained for at least 30 days after testing is completed, or until work utilizing this material is completed (e.g., aggregates for Asphalt Concrete mix designs). Upon client request, samples may be retained for longer periods. After expiration of the time limit the client is contacted for sample disposal instructions.

####	Sample Disposal

**Non-hazardous Materials**<br/>
Non-hazardous materials are discarded in a waste container to be collected and hauled away by a contracted firm.

**Hazardous Materials**<br/>
Hazardous materials generated as part of the asphalt extraction test procedure are collected and stored in DOT approved containers and disposed of using a registered hazardous waste hauler. No Hazardous Materials are accepted by the Laboratory other than those specifically generated during testing.
